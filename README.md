# ECONOMETRICS-
using R and stata to uncover patterns, causation, and to generally infer (economic) relationships between different variables 

here, we deal a lot with linear models and extensions of lm such as logistic, probit, and others when different situations call for it 

we also learn to detect confounding variables, use different techniques to solve it so as to get meaningful estimates of relationships
